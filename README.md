![Portfolio Website](link-to-your-portfolio-website-screenshot)

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project was built using React, harnessing the power of Create React App for rapid development and seamless user experience. Below, you'll find useful information on how to get started, run tests, build for production, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with exploring my portfolio:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run the app in development mode with `npm start`.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:
